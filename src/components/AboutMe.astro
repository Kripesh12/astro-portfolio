          I'm a passionate fullstack developer based in Nepal, dedicated to
          creating seamless digital experiences. My journey in tech started with
          curiosity and has evolved into a career building products that matter.
        </p>
        <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
          I love working with modern technologies like TypeScript, Go, React,
          and Next.js to build scalable applications. Whether it's crafting a
          beautiful frontend or architecting robust backend systems, I bring the
          same level of attention to detail and passion for excellence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
          contributing to open source, or sharing knowledge with the developer
          community.
